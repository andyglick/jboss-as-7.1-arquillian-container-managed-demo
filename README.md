# Arquillian tests for JBoss AS 7.1 for EAP 6.4

started with an old copy of the Arquillian tutorial, which was working
fine driving Weld and Glassfish but which wasn't workin for JBoss AS.
After many hours of fussing with jars have been able to start JBoss and
execute a test in the container context.

Additionally have hooked Jacoco up to produce coverage reports.
